Create a dynamic booking system for SS Paradise Residency's website that includes the following features and specifications:

Booking Information Fields:

Capture and display essential booking details, including:
Full Name
Title (e.g., Admin)
Email
Check-in Date
Check-out Date
Number of Rooms Selected (synchronized with the 'Select Rooms' choice from the previous page)
Number of Guests
Payment Option
Room Selection Synchronization:

Ensure that the number of rooms selected on the previous page (Select Rooms) is updated and displayed consistently across all pages where booking details are shown.
When a user modifies the room selection, automatically update the number of rooms in all instances across the site, including in summaries, payment pages, and confirmation emails.
Data Persistence:

Implement a system that stores the booking information temporarily throughout the booking process. This ensures users can navigate between pages without losing data.
Use session storage or a similar method to maintain information until the booking is complete.
Automatic Calculation of Total Cost:

Include logic to calculate the total cost based on room selection, number of nights, and any additional options. Display this in real-time as the user adjusts their selections.
User-Friendly Interface:

Provide a summary panel that displays the booking details (including room count) on each step of the booking process, ensuring clarity for the user.
Ensure any updates to information, like dates or room selection, are immediately reflected in this summary panel.
Confirmation and Syncing Across Pages:

Upon finalizing the booking, generate a summary page and confirmation email that includes all booking details, including the selected number of rooms.
Maintain synchronization with all backend records to ensure accuracy if the user revisits their booking details later.
Responsive Design and Accessibility:

Ensure the booking system is responsive on all device sizes and accessible to all users, providing clear labels and instructions.
This system will streamline the booking process, provide accurate, synchronized information across all parts of the website, and improve user experience by allowing easy modifications and updates."
